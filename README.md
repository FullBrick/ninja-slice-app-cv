# Ninja Slice ü•∑üèªüçâ
Basically, this project deals with making a game similar to the classic Fruit Ninja, *but with a small twist*.Instead of swipe/touch controls, we plan on implementing a **controller which process your hands' movements and uses it to slice the fruits**.

The game assets and mechanics are made in Unity and whose repo can be found [here](https://github.com/FullBrick/ninja-slice-app-core).

This Repository serves as Ninja Slice Game's Official Codebase for the **Computer Vision and Image Processing**.

The Unity Instance and our Python server will communicate using UDP Protocol as it is quite suitable for real-time data transfer. For the Image Processing and Tracking, we will go ahead with OpenCV.
